Here’s a paragraph written in Markdown with some formatting:  

---

**The quick brown fox** jumps over the *lazy dog*. This is an example of **bold** and *italic* text in Markdown.  

If you want to `highlight code`, use backticks (`). For longer code blocks, you can use triple backticks:  

```python
def hello_world():  
    print("Hello, Markdown!")  
```  

> **Blockquotes** are created using `>`. They’re useful for quotes or important notes.  

Need a line break? Add two spaces at the end of a line.  
Like this!  

Or just separate paragraphs with an empty line.  

~~Strikethrough~~ is done with double tildes (`~~`).
